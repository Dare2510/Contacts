## Features
- Add new contacts (name, phone number, email)
- View all contacts
- Search for a contact by name
- Update or delete existing contacts
- Simple console-based user interface

## Technologies Used
- Java SE
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Console I/O
- Basic data structures (e.g., lists or maps)

Learning Goals

Practice Java basics: loops, conditions, and user input

Implement object-oriented concepts: classes, objects, encapsulation

Handle CRUD operations: create, read, update, delete entries

Work with simple data structures like lists or maps
